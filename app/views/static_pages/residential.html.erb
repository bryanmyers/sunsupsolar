      <p>The customers needs were to reduce their PG&E electric bills as they were in excess of $600 per month.</p>

      <%= image_tag("ObertoGarageArrays.jpg", alt: "Santa Cruz Array Image") %>

      <p>The solar pv system installed consisted of 36 220W solar panels in two arrays of 22 & 14 panels. The two roof mounted arrays faced South South West and South respectively. These arrays were served by two SMA inverters.</p>

      <p>The system produces 10,220kWh per year and reduces carbon emissions by 182 tons over the systems lifetime. That's equivalent to over 375,600 air miles or 52 return flights between  San Francisco and London!!</p>

      <p>Their average electric bill is now $50</p>

      <em><p>"I used to dread the time of the month when my PG&E bill arrived. Now I can't wait!"</p>

      <p>"Peter and his SUNS UP SOLAR team were first class they were here during the hottest part of the year, but worked hard and finished in 3 days.!! The guys always cleaned up after themselves and nothing was too much trouble. They replaced my comp roof as well while they were up there as it was over 16 years old."</p>

      <p>The difficulty with this site, however, was a large stand of eucalyptus trees which prevented us utilizing the South facing roof. The solution was to locate the two arrays on the East, South East roof maximising the production for the owner.</p>

      <p>There is a misconception that solar arrays must face south. Obviously it is ideal but an East facing array will harvest approximately 87% of the same array facing South. So if a customer really wants to go solar we just have to size the system accordingly.</p>

      <p>The solar pv system installed consisted of 26 210W Schuco solar panels in two arrays of 13 panels. The two roof mounted arrays faced East South East. These arrays were served by one SMA inverter.</p>

      <p>The system produces in excess of 6,600kWh per year and will reduce carbon emissions by 116 tons over the systems lifetime. That’s equivalent to 147,500 SUV miles.</p>

      <p>This system was installed as part of a complete refit and remodel of the home. We liaised with Architects and General Contractor to ensure the system was integrated into the remodel and minimised disruption to the work schedule.</p>

      <p>The remodel included enhancements to energy efficiencies such as insulation and windows thus reducing energy consumption even further.</p>

      <p>The solar pv system installed consisted of 15 210W Schuco solar panels which were roof mounted and faced South.</p>

      <p>These arrays were served by one SMA inverter.</p>

      <p>Following our site survey and energy analysis we recommended that the customer replace a old very large freezer in his garage. This together with other energy recommendations reduced his energy consumption by 45%. We then sized the system based on the new usage  ($250/month average). ROI including energy efficiencies is less than 5 years!!</p> 

      <p>We also replaced the existing wood shake roof covering with a new composite shingle 50 year TL roof.</p>

      <p>The solar pv system installed consisted of 30# 180W Schuco solar modules. The roof mounted array faced South. This array is served by Schuco SMA inverter.</p>

      <p>The system produces 7,885kWh per year and reduces carbon emissions by 144 tons over the systems lifetime. That's equivalent to over 296,000 air miles or 30 return flights between  San Francisco and London!!</p>

       <em><p>"For us it is all about securing our families financial future. Solar does this for us as it reduces our outgoings . With the money I am saving on my electric bill this sytem will pay for itself in around 5 years. After that its all free energy!!"</p>
